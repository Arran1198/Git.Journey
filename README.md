i'm writing this so to it be a, little journal of the things i do in tech and programming.

___Day 000 until this point its has been 2 years since i practiced basics of python and a great deal in depth c++ programming language
still day 000 and i'm by road map 2 month into in depth training for Software Engineering, and 1 year into iran, kerman azad university
of kerman, practicing computer engineering. And also 2 week into practicing self learn German / Deutsch for fun.
and day 3 of creating a To-Do list via c++ programming language altough still no luck.

____Day 001 today i wrote a new form of plan or flow chart to write a percise schedule to write code and peractice my other skills, and
also its a value to have the discipline to put it to the motion and act on it, i may be successfull. 

____Day 002 today was the day to create a to-do list by cpp in which i desire to use FLTK library. and i obviously have to install it first which in 
windows is not an easy task to do, and other than that i have to make neccessary perperations for it.

_also creating a 6-month road-map for game-development in unreal engine. actually an adventage is to make cpp based games with it.
